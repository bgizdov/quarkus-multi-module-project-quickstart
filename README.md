Here’s an improved GitHub description for your project:


# Quarkus 3 Multi-Module Project Quickstart

This repository provides a quickstart template for building a multi-module project using Quarkus 3.15 LTS, featuring Lombok and Jandex. 

## Project Structure

The project is structured into two main modules:

- quickstart-core: Contains the core functionality and business logic.
- quickstart-rest: Exposes RESTful APIs for client interactions.

Additional modules can be easily incorporated, such as HTML rendering, runners, and various services.

## Git Repository Management

Modules can reside in separate Git repositories, allowing for flexible management using Git submodules.

# Quarkus Project

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
./mvnw package
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory. Be aware that it’s
not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container
using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/code-with-quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please
